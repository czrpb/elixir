# Histogram

## What is it?

It is a visualization of the distribution of your data.

What distribution is visualized? You determine the grouping -- or the technical term
is `binning` -- of your data.

In the simplest case, if/when you data is numerical, you choose the ranges of your bins or
you choose the number of bins in the range of your data. You then count the frequency
of your data in the bins.
